# Hacker rank and me

Solution of the problems set in [Hacker rank](https://www.hackerrank.com). This implementations are an exercise for me to better understand and apply Python to solve problems in general.

I use Jupyter Notebook to test my implementations. At the end of the implementation I will post the best solution I found in the corresponding Hacker rank discussion section. This to compare my implementation and see the differences and what new concepts can I learn.
